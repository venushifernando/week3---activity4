Week 3 – Activity 4: SQLite3 College Database
This project is a small object‑oriented Python application that uses the built‑in sqlite3 module to manage a simple college database stored in a local SQLite file. The design follows the ER diagram from Week 3 Activity 3, with entities for students, teachers, courses, lessons, and delivery.​

Scenario
A college needs to keep track of which students are enrolled in which courses and which teachers are delivering those courses. The database contains:

Student – basic details about each student

Teacher – basic details about each teacher

Course – course code, name, and credit value

Lesson – enrolments linking a student to a course and the teacher for that lesson

Delivery – which teacher delivers which course

The goal of this activity is to build the database and run specific queries using SQLite and Python.

Features
Creates all required tables using CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS statements in SQLite.​

Inserts sample data for students, teachers, courses, lessons, and deliveries.

Uses SQL queries and the sqlite3 API to:​

show the number of students enrolled in course MSE800

list all teacher names who are teaching course MSE801

How to run
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.​

Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

Run the main program:

bash
python main.py
The script will create college.db (if it does not exist), build the tables, insert sample data, and print:

the total number of students in MSE800

the names of teachers who teach MSE801.

Files in this project
main.py – Python source code that creates the database, inserts data, and runs the required queries using sqlite3.​

college.db – SQLite database file generated by the program (can be recreated at any time).
